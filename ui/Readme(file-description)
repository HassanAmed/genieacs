File description for all pages files

All the files are named against their page and each file that has "page" in it means that it
create page component of that specific page which is then used in app.ts to render.

All files are indiviual components which bundle together to create frontend view.
Most of files names are self explanatory for thier description. 
Inside components are basic front end triggers like onclick() trigger. Please run the server and 
then go throught each page code file while you see ui so that it will be self explainatory for you
to understand.

There is putActionHandler() function in each page file that calls store function to make api
requests.
