/**
 * Naive DPLL solver for propositional logic adapted from

 *
 * Origianl code by Tanel Tammet released under the MIT license.
 *
 * Check whether a clause set is satisfiable or contradictory, using a naive
 * implementation of the dpll (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) procedure
 * combining truth table search with the resolution-like unit propagation.
 *
 * The standard pure-literal rule is not implemented in this naive version,
 * since it is not really crucial for the algorithm.
 *
 * The code is very similar to the pure table solver, except we use a
 * unit-propagating, derived-varlist-returing satisfiableAt.

 * Check whether clauses are satisfiable under the varVals assignment, without

 * Iterate through all clauses and check whether
 *
 *  - all literals in the clause are assigned false: undo derived units (set
 *    values in varVals to 0) and return false immediately
 *
 *  - a clause contains a literal assigned true: skip further actions on this
 *    clause
 *
 *  - a single literal in the clause is unassigned, all the rest are assigned
 *    false: derive this literal as a unit clause.
 *
 * In case at least one literal is derived during the process above, iterate
 * the whole process until no more new literals are derived.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *   1: all clauses were assigned true, hence the clause set is satisfiable.
 *   The whole search will terminate after that.
 *
 *   -1: clause set is contradictory. Derived units have been restored.
 *
 *   a list of derived variables:  the status of the clause set is
 *   undetermined. The values of variables on the list will be restored (set to
 *   0) during backtracking.
